                <p>Gjøvikregionen International School (GIS) is a young international school, which opened in August 2015. We have grown rapidly from 30 students in 2015 to 192 students this academic year (2021/2022), with waiting lists in several grade levels. Located in close proximity of NTNU, GIS became an IB World School offering the IB Primary Years Programme in July 2018 and IB Middle Years Programme in June 2019. Our graduates are well prepared to continue their education in the IB Diploma Programme at any IB school in the world, including Gjøvik High School.</p>

                <p>GIS provides a transdisciplinary programme of internationally-oriented education to foster the development of the whole child.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our goal is to become a leading IB World School, offering the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) as well as the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP).

                    <br>
                    In order to become authorized by the IB, among other requirements, schools need to prove that they have established a curriculum that is in line with IB guidelines and requirements. Therefore, we are already implementing a curriculum that have designed in accordance with IB expectations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Aware of the fact that some students may need to move to the Norwegian system, we offer Norwegian language classes with a view to maintaining a high standard of speaking, reading and writing skills.
