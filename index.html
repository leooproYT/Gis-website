                <h3>GIS Mission:</h3>
                <p style="color: #ff4a4a"><b>Our schools mission is to provide authentic international education to foster an enthusiasm to explore and the security to pursue individual goals. As a growth-oriented school, we aim to cultivate highly skilled and responsible global citizens rooted in our local community.</b></p>

        <h1>Welcome To GIS</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Gj√∏vikregionen International School (GIS) and thank you for visiting us in this virtual reality. GIS is more than just a school. It is an ambitious project created by forward-looking people who are passionate about education. We challenged ourselves to establish a centre for education that will prepare students for a future that we can only try to predict. At GIS, we take great care to create meaningful opportunities for our students to become resilient learners who display a growth mindset and an entrepreneurial spirit.
            <br>
            <br>
In order to attain our aims, we chose to use the educational framework of the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (PYP) and the Middle Years Programme (MYP). We are currently an authorized IB World School offering both programmes and awaiting our first evaluation visit in 2023.
            <br>
            <br>
At GIS, we believe that a school‚Äôs greatest asset is the teachers. Therefore, we have recruited enthusiastic and innovative PYP and MYP teachers, who nurture our students‚Äô curiosity and love for learning. Our educators do their best to equip your child with the skills needed to confidently and consciously take responsibility for their academic, social and personal development.
            <br>
            <br>
Thrilled about our brand new facilities that we have designed ourselves, we aim much farther than the walls of our school. We intend to take learning out of the school premises to the most appropriate locations for any given subject matter under scrutiny. It is one of our strategic goals that GIS becomes a magnet for local experts that the Gj√∏vik region is so rich in. Feel free to contact us if you want to be part of the teaching and learning at our school.<br>
Please take the time to explore our website to learn more about GIS. Do not hesitate to call or email us should you have any questions. However, we value personal contact most and would encourage you to schedule a visit. We appreciate that selecting a school for your child is a big decision to make. We will be very happy to assist you in the process.
            <br>
            <br>
I would encourage you to check back regularly to learn about the latest developments at GIS! Also, follow us on Facebook.
            <br>
            <br>
I look forward to welcoming you to our school and community.
            <br>
            <br>
Kind regards,
            <br>
            <br>
