                    cultures with their beliefs, customs and traditions, and languages. We recognize 
                    the central role of language in constructing one’s identity as well as academic, social and
                     emotional development of every child. We are committed to supporting families in their efforts to 
                     maintain their mother tongues.</p>

                <img class="about-gis-pics2" src="https://i.ibb.co/hWRyJpT/242396793-4463185890370947-324249174113684873-n.jpg">
                <div class="multitounge"><p>The language of instruction at GIS is English. For a vast majority of our students, English is a second or third language. Research shows that the development of a child’s mother tongue is directly linked to the development of additional languages. The mastery of skills in the mother tongue is a strong foundation for the development of these skills in another language. Conversely, if a student fails to reach a certain level of mastery of their mother tongue, they will struggle to learn other languages. Therefore, at GIS, we see mother tongues as a springboard for an effective acquisition of the English language, which is crucial to academic success.

                <div class="multitounge"> <p>Educating parents about the importance of mother tongue/sharing with parents the benefits of maintaining one’s mother tongue through the school’s website, school newsletter and information events.<br>
Helping families make initial contact with families from their home country or who share the same mother tongue.<br>
Encouraging community members to offer after school clubs with a focus on maintaining and developing mother tongues.<br>
Providing access to a growing range of resources to support mother tongues.<br>
Encouraging community members to donate resources in languages other than those taught at school (English, Norwegian and German).<br>
Encouraging families to speak and read in their mother tongues at home.<br>
Holding school events that showcase the variety of mother tongues represented in the school community.<br>
Encouraging parents to find materials in the home language that are related to what the child is learning at school in the units of inquiry. (Talk with your child about the concepts and vocabulary they are learning at school. You will often be able to have a deeper discussion of the issue than your child is able to sustain in English at school.)<br>
Encouraging parents to organize playdates, language lessons and vacation trips that will allow the child to practice their mother tongue.
